# shop-client

A front-end framework template for starting projects with a recent version of
either the [Rails API Template](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/rails-api-template)
or the [Express API Template](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/express-api-template).

## Project Planning
### User Stories
- As an unregistered user, I would like to sign up with email and password.
- As a registered user, I would like to sign in with email and password.
- As a signed in user, I would like to change password.
- As a signed in user, I would like to sign out.
- As an unregistered user, I would like to see all of the products.
- As a signed in user, I would like to add and remove products from a shopping cart.
- As a signed in user, I would like to purchase products in a shopping cart using Stripe with react https://github.com/azmenak/react-stripe-checkout
- As a signed in user, I would like to see all my past orders.

#### Reach Goal(s)
- Build a search feature so that people can search for specific products by name.

### Included Routes

This template comes with a handful of front-end routes that display
different components for user actions.

| Endpoint           | Component         | `AuthenticatedRoute`? |
|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| `/sign-up`         | `SignUp`          | No                    |
| `/sign-in`         | `SignIn`          | No                    |
| `/change-password` | `ChangePassword`  | Yes                   |
| `/sign-out`        | `SignOut`         | Yes                   |

There is no HTTP verb listed because these are all front-end routes handled by
React. Some of these routes should not be available unless a user is signed in,
so they will use the `AuthenticatedRoute` component instead of the regular
`Route`. This custom component is provided as part of the template, and is not
a part of the React library (see more below).

## Features

### `<AuthenticatedRoute />`

This template contains a handy component for creating routes that require a
user to be authenticated before visiting. This component lives in
`src/auth/components/AuthenticatedRoute.js` and is already required in `App`.
It's a thin wrapper around React Router's `<Route />` component. The only
difference is that it expects a prop called `user`, and if that prop is falsy,
it will render a `<Redirect />` that takes the user to `/`. **To use
it, you must pass it the user as a prop!**

It supports both the `component=` and `render=` attributes, but like `<Route />`
it will not forward props to the component if you use `component=`.

### `<AutoDismissAlert />` Component

This template also already contains a component that displays user messages.
Messages are configurable via redux actions.  This component can be found in
`src/components/AutoDismissAlert/AutoDismissAlert.js`. **There is no need to add
this component to your app. It is already required in `App`.**  A single
component instance is used to manage all alerts application-wide.

The alert can be used by passing the `alertMsg` method to a rendered route.  The
`alertMsg` method expects an object with a `heading`, `message`, and a `variant` property.

Use this component in conjunction with the `messages.js` file in the same
directory to create and manage all of your application messages in one place.

The `variant` property must be a Bootstrap alert variant, as this component is merely a
wrapper around the [react-bootstrap Alert
component](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/alerts/).  The types it
will accept are: 'primary', 'secondary', 'success', 'danger', 'warning', 'info',
'light', and 'dark'.

 To change the duration of the message, replace `5000` with a value of your
 choice (in milliseconds) in this component's `componentDidMount` method.

### `src/apiConfig.js`

Just like in
[browser-template](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/browser-template),
this file will determine whether you're in a production or development
environment and choose an API URL accordingly. Don't forget to replace the
`production` URL with your deployed API's URL.

### Bootstrap

This template includes two different implementations of the classic Bootstrap
library we know and love.

#### `bootstrap`

The first implementation of Bootstrap comes from the `bootstrap` npm package,
and provides all of the normal Bootstrap classes and styling we were able to
use with the `browser-template`. This package is included in the
`src/index.scss` file at the very top of the file. That means JSX in this
template can utilize Bootstrap classes like `btn`, `container`, `row`, etc.

See an example below:

```jsx
import React from 'react'

const AboutPage = () => (
  <div className="card">
    <div className="card-body">
      <h1 className="card-title">About Page</h1>
      <p className="card-text">There is a Bootstrap card on this page!</p>
    </div>
  </div>
)

export default AboutPage
```

> Note: Remember to use `className` not `class` in your JSX!

#### `react-bootstrap`

In addition to the classic Bootstrap classes we can plug into our JSX, this
template also comes with a special package called [`react-bootstrap`](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/).
This package allows us to use special React components that have been pre-built
according to the Bootstrap library.

Import components from the `react-bootstrap` library, then use them just like
regular components in your JSX!

See an example below:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import Card from 'react-bootstrap/Card'

const AboutPage = () => (
  <Card>
    <Card.Body>
      <Card.Title>The About Page</Card.Title>
      <Card.Text>There is a Bootstrap card on this page!</Card.Text>
    </Card.Body>
  </Card>
)

export default AboutPage
```

## Tasks

Developers should run these often!

- `npm run nag`: runs code quality analysis tools on your code and complains.
- `npm run make-standard`: reformats all your code in the JavaScript Standard
  Style.
- `npm run start`: generates bundles, watches, and livereloads.
- `npm run build`: place bundled styles and scripts where `index.html` can find
    them
- `npm run deploy`: builds and deploys main branch
